        <h1><em><b></b></em><center>Life at the Bulldog<center/></em></b></h1>
       <p> I started cooking in 1992, by 1995 I graduated from culinary school and spent many years honing my craft, by 2002 I was a burnout and decided to go back to college. I moved to Columbia, and attended the University of Missouri and there I studied Political Science, don't ask me why, I just felt like spending tens of thousands of dollars on a useless piece of paper.  
           I didn't want to cook while I was in school, so I took a job as a psychiatric aide at the local mental hospital, it wasn't very different from working in a restaurant because you have to be a certain level of insane to work in one, the only difference I saw was the patients had better drugs.
           Fast forward to 2010, I moved back to Kansas City, I still didn't want to work in restaurants, and having experience in mental health, I again took a job in a psychiatric facility. I worked as a tech for a couple of years, until one October morning.
           A patient that was known to staff as being violent (unless sedated) was staying with us, on that morning he woke up in a bad mood because he couldn't use the phone. A nurse who was just coming on shift had tried to redirect him, but he wasn't having it and took a swing at her. If you're unfamiliar with what techs do on 
           the units, we were basically bodyguards, just a physical presence that routinely gets thrown in harms way when something goes sideways, and it did, and I intervened. My intervention resulted in this 6'4", 375 pound man breaking my wrist. My days of working with patients were effectively over and after a surgery, a couple of pins, and a lot of physical therapy I was exiled to work as a clerk in an outpatient facility.
           I filed this and stapled that, I hated my job, I couldn't go on like this. One evening I was out at a bar with my girlfriend, she was watching a basketball game and I was reading a Bon Appetite magazine that just came in the mail. While I sat there reading, I felt a familiar pang, I wanted to create again, I was ready to go back to kitchen life.<br/>
           I turned to her and said 'I hate my job and I want to quit'<br/> her response was 'So do it'. <br/><br/> The within a couple of weeks I was hired at<i><b>The Bulldog</b></i>

                    <h2>Back in the saddle</h2>
                    <p>I would love to say that making the decision to go back into the lifestyle of a chef was one without hesitation, truth is, I didn't know if I still had it in me.
                       I knew that they needed a creative boost, I knew that they needed leadership, but nothing could have prepared me for what was to come.<br/>
                       I was introduced to the kitchen as just another cook, the owner and I thought it would be best if the other cooks didn't know I was the new chef, they didn't have one for a very long time, so naturally they looked at the new guy and thought I was it. I was, but they didn't need to know that just yet.
                       For the most part the people in the kitchen were good at what they did, but without anyone there to direct them, they had turned into a version of "Lord of the Flies", each one trying to be bossy to the other, nobody had the conch, everyone had a knife.
                       As for me, and the years that I had spent away from the kitchen, well, it wasnt without it's challenges, namely, I burnt things, lots of them, including me.<br>I got better though, much better...</br>
